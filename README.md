## Features

## Requirements

-   JDK 11 
-   Apache Maven 3.3 or higher
-   Git Client
-   Docker (To build the docker image)

## Getting Started

### Building

Execute:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Running

Execute:

```bash
java -jar target/server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Testing

By default the service will be available at:

`http://localhost:7070/Service/WMLS`

Execute the following SOAP query to get the version:
```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:soapenc="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/" xmlns:tns="http://www.witsml.org/wsdl/120" xmlns:types="http://www.witsml.org/wsdl/120/encodedTypes" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
   <soap:Body soap:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">
     <q1:WMLS_GetVersion xmlns:q1="http://www.witsml.org/message/120" />
   </soap:Body>
 </soap:Envelope>
```
 
By default the server should return the following response:
 
 ```xml
 <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
    <soap:Body>
      <ns1:WMLS_GetVersionResponse xmlns:ns1="http://www.witsml.org/wsdl/120">
        <return xmlns:ns2="http://www.witsml.org/wsdl/120">1.3.1.1,1.4.1.1</return>
      </ns1:WMLS_GetVersionResponse>
    </soap:Body>
  </soap:Envelope>
  ```

### CVE Checking

Drillflow includes the [OWASP Dependancy checker](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck) Maven Plugin

To check if any dependencies are subject to any current CVE's run

```bash
mvn verify
```

### Building the Docker image

Navigate to the docker directory

Execute `docker build . -t hashmapinc/witsmlapi-server:latest` to build the image

Once completed execute `docker run -p 7070:7070 hashmapinc/witsmlapi-server:latest`
